{"name":"Choose Your Own Python","body":"### Welcome!\r\nChoose Your Own Python is a collection of \"choose your own adventure\" games written in python. I wrote these games to both expand my knowledge of Python and for my little brother to play. \r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nTo play any of these games, install Python to your computer and execute one of the .py files. Alternatively, you can install IDLE, a python IDE, and run it from there.  \r\n\r\n### Included Games\r\n\r\n1. Choose-Your-Own-Python\r\n \r\n2. Space Adventure\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThe game Space Adventure (spaceadventure.py) is currently in the process of being separated into distinct files based on the chapters in the game. In order to play the game, you can either execute spaceadventure.py, or you can try downloading chapter_one.py, chapter_two.py, chapter_three.py, and main.py, putting them into one folder together, and executing main.py. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAaron Smith maintains and develops the Choose Your Own Python portfolio.\r\n\r\nIsaac Smith provides both general and ease of use testing. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with my game?

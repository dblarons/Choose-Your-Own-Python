Choose Your Own Python is a collection of "Choose-Your-Own" adventure games written in python. I wrote these games to expand my knowledge of Python and for my little brother to play. To run, install Python to your computer and execute one of the .py files. Alternatively, you can install IDLE, a python IDE, and run it from there. 

Games included:

1. Choose-Your-Own-Python 

    (Choose-Your-Own-Python.py)

2. Space Adventure

    (spaceadventure.py)

3. Classy Western

    (classywestern.py)

Note: spaceadventure.py is currently in the process of being separated into distinct files based on the chapters in the game. In order to play the game, you can still run spaceadventure.py, or you can try downloading chapter_one.py, chapter_two.py, chapter_three.py, and main.py, putting them into one folder together, and executing main.py.
